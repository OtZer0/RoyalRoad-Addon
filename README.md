# RoyalRoad Full Text Addon

This addon adds an option to read the full text of a story on RR, instead of one chapter at a time.
If you like this addon, please review it!

## Features
- Adds all pages of the story to one page to allow seamless reading!
- A loading bar to show how close you are to loading the whole story!
- After the first chapter is loaded, removes overlay to allow loading in the background while you're reading!
- Works from any chapter, loading that first, then the chapters after it, then the ones before, to allow you to jump right into the story!
- Works on Firefox and Firefox for Android!
